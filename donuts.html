      <p>A donut is a type of deep fried dough confectionery or dessert food.
      The doughnut is popular in many countries and prepared in various forms
      as a sweet snack that can be homemade or purchased in bakeries, supermarkets,
    food stalls, and franchised specialty outlets.</p>

    <p class="box">Did you know? Donut can also be spelled "doughnut."</p>

    <p>The two most common types are the toroidal ring doughnut and
    the filled doughnut&mdash;which is injected with fruit preserves,
  cream, custard, or other sweet fillings. A small spherical piece of dough may
  be cooked as a doughnut hole. Other shapes include rings, balls, and flattened
  spheres, as well as ear shapes, twists and other forms. Doughnut varieties are also
  divided into cake and risen type doughnuts.</p>
